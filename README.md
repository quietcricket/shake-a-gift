## Code locations
* The PAGE_TITLE attribute should just use the client's Twitter display name, unless special request is given. This will be displayed in the website preview card on Twitter timeline. 
* The color of timer circle can be adjusted in main.css under #timer-color1 and #timer color2
* It's very unlikely SHAKE_THRESHOLD and SHAKE_INTERVAL need to be adjusted. These 2 parameters will drastically change how many shakes the user can achieve in 8 seconds.
